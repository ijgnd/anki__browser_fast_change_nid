### Add-on for Anki 2.1: change nid from browser for selected cards/notes

Use this at your own risk!

This can permanently damage your collection! Don't use this on your real collection without verifying the code!

This is not stable but alpha quality software.

To use this add-on you must have the add-on [Advanced Browser](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/874215009) and in the Advanced Browser settings you must enable "Show internal fields". In the browser you must enable the "- Only show notes -" mode and the table must be sorted by the note-id (nid). Then you will see additional entries in the context menu.

For some background about the meaning of nids see https://github.com/ijgnd/anki21___note-organizer/blob/master/README.md

The code for changing the note-id is adapted from [a commit to the Advanced Browser add-on by Arthur](https://github.com/hssm/advanced-browser/commit/7fba8f30f0ebd12b2f458f8a56ec7c6c068ddf24).

Feedback and bug reports are welcome.
